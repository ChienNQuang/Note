# Note App - Complete Project Planning Documentation

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: This Project Has Been Refactored**

This documentation has been updated to reflect a major architectural pivot towards a **unified node model**, inspired by applications like Logseq and Tana.

**Key Changes**:
-   **No More Pages/Blocks**: Everything is now a single entity called a **Node**.
-   **Journal-First Workflow**: The application opens to a daily journal.
-   **Bi-Directional Linking**: A core feature for creating a knowledge graph.
-   **Dark Theme by Default**.

Please review the updated documents before proceeding with implementation.

- Mentor junior developers on complex concepts

### For Junior Developers
Each major feature includes:
- ✅ **Planning**: Clear requirements and acceptance criteria
- ✅ **Design**: UI/UX mockups and technical specifications  
- ✅ **Implementation**: Step-by-step coding tasks
- ✅ **Testing**: Unit, integration, and manual test cases
- ✅ **Validation**: User acceptance and quality criteria

### Development Best Practices
- Start with failing tests (TDD approach)
- Implement features incrementally
- Regular code reviews and pair programming
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## 🔍 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **CRDT Complexity**: Start with simple implementation, iterate

## ⚠️ Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### Issues Identified
1. **Missing Page Management**: Block system needs Pages to exist first
2. **Database Over-Engineering**: Schema included unused features from later phases  
3. **CRDT Integration**: Data models weren't prepared for collaboration features
4. **Premature File System**: File integration came before required dependencies
5. **Testing Misalignment**: Tests assumed complete features too early

### Fixes Applied
1. ✅ **Added Page Management System** to Phase 1 (Week 4)  
2. ✅ **Simplified Database Schema** to only core tables initially
3. ✅ **Enhanced Data Models** with CRDT-preparation fields
4. ✅ **Moved File System Integration** to Phase 2 after Git
5. ✅ **Aligned Testing Strategy** with incremental development

### Result
- **Timeline**: 32 weeks (was 28 weeks) - more realistic
- **Dependencies**: All critical blocking issues resolved  
- **Implementation**: Much smoother development path
- **Architecture**: Maintains all original capabilities
