# Note App - Complete Project Planning Documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Read This First!

**Before implementing anything, read the [Review Analysis](REVIEW_ANALYSIS.md)** which identifies critical dependency issues in the original plan and provides corrected solutions.

**Use the [Corrected Roadmap](roadmap/02-corrected-roadmap.md)** instead of the original roadmap for implementation.

## üìã Overview

This directory contains comprehensive project planning documentation for the Note application - a local-first, Git-native note-taking app built with Vue 3, TypeScript, Rust, and Tauri. The documentation follows a top-down approach from high-level architecture to granular implementation tasks suitable for junior developers.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Vision

**Building a local-first, Git-native note-taking app that addresses Logseq's limitations with real-time collaboration, extensibility, and cross-platform performance.**

### Core Principles
- **Local-First**: All data lives locally, sync is optional
- **Git-Native**: Automatic versioning and change tracking  
- **Block-Centric**: Everything is a referenceable block with UUID
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: WebSocket + CRDT for multi-user editing
- **Cross-Platform**: Desktop-first with mobile support
- **Performance**: Handle 10,000+ blocks without lag

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### Issues Identified
1. **Missing Page Management**: Block system needs Pages to exist first
2. **Database Over-Engineering**: Schema included unused features from later phases  
3. **CRDT Integration**: Data models weren't prepared for collaboration features
4. **Premature File System**: File integration came before required dependencies
5. **Testing Misalignment**: Tests assumed complete features too early

### Fixes Applied
1. ‚úÖ **Added Page Management System** to Phase 1 (Week 4)  
2. ‚úÖ **Simplified Database Schema** to only core tables initially
3. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Data Models** with CRDT-preparation fields
4. ‚úÖ **Moved File System Integration** to Phase 2 after Git
5. ‚úÖ **Aligned Testing Strategy** with incremental development

### Result
- **Timeline**: 32 weeks (was 28 weeks) - more realistic
- **Dependencies**: All critical blocking issues resolved  
- **Implementation**: Much smoother development path
- **Architecture**: Maintains all original capabilities
